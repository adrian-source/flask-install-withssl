flask-install-withssl
=====================

Installs flask using virtualenv.ssh and downloads all the common libraries and creates initial index page.

1. Create a folder for your app
2. Download virtualenv.py and place it in that folder
3. Download flask-install-withssl.sh and place it in that folder
4. Run flask-install-withssl.sh

NOTE: There is not SSL - I never got to automate that process...
