flask-install-withssl
=====================

Installs flask using virtualenv.ssh with https

1. Create a folder for your app
2. Download virtualenv.py and place it in that folder
3. Download flask-install-withssl.sh and place it in that folder
4. Run flask-install-withssl.sh

Funny thing is that SSL support will come soon.
